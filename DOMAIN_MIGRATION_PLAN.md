## Architecture Decisions

✅ **Approved architectural choices:**

### 1. Application Layer Pattern
- **Decision:** Use Application Services for cross-domain orchestration
- **Rationale:** Keeps domain boundaries clean, prevents domain coupling
- **Examples:** Dashboard, RSVP Submission, Household Management

### 2. Question Domain
- **Decision:** Single unified Question domain
- **Rationale:** Same validation, same behavior, just different context (Event vs Website)
- **Implementation:** Service layer enforces business rule (must belong to one, not both)

### 3. Frontend Organization
- **Decision:** Feature-based routes, domain-based components
- **Rationale:** Routes match user mental model, components are reusable
- **Structure:**
  - Routes: `/dashboard`, `/guest-list`, `/auth`
  - Components: `_components/event/`, `_components/guest/`

### 4. Migration Approach
- **Decision:** Incremental, one domain at a time
- **Rationale:** Low risk, testable, can learn and adapt
- **Order:** Simple → Complex (see Migration Strategy)

### 5. Cross-Domain Operations
- **Decision:** Application Services orchestrate domains
- **Example:** Household creation needs Guest + Invitation → HouseholdManagementService
- **Pattern:** Service layer doesn't call other services directly

## Domain Structure

### Core Business Domains (8 Domains)

| Domain | Entities | Responsibility |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Event** | Event | Wedding events/ceremonies |
| **Guest** | Guest | Individual guest management |
| **Household** | Household | Guest household/address groups |
| **Invitation** | Invitation | Event invitations & RSVP tracking |
| **Gift** | Gift | Gift tracking per household |
| **Question** | Question, Option, Answer, OptionResponse | RSVP questions & responses (Event + Website) |
| **Website** | Website | Wedding website configuration |
| **User** | User | User/couple account management |

### Application Services (3 Services)

| Service | Orchestrates | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Dashboard** | Event, Guest, Household, Website, User | Overview & statistics |
| **RSVP Submission** | Household, Guest, Invitation, Question | Guest RSVP flow |
| **Household Management** | Household, Guest, Invitation, Gift | Complex household creation |

### Infrastructure (Technical)

- **Database:** Prisma client wrapper
- **Storage:** S3 service for file uploads
- **Email:** Email service (future)

## Layer Responsibilities

### 1. Domain Layer (`server/domains/`)

**Responsibility:** Business entities and their operations

**Contains:**
- Types (domain-specific)
- Validators (Zod schemas)
- Repository (database access)
- Service (business logic)
- Router (thin tRPC layer)

**Rules:**
- ✅ Can read from own repository
- ✅ Can contain business rules
- ✅ Can validate own data
- ❌ Cannot call other domain services
- ❌ Cannot call other repositories
- ❌ Cannot contain orchestration logic

**Example:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Event service manages events
class EventService {
  async createEvent(userId: string, data: CreateEventInput) {
    // Validate business rules
    if (data.date && new Date(data.date) < new Date()) {
      throw new Error('Event date cannot be in the past')
    }
    // Use own repository
    return this.eventRepo.create(userId, data)
  }
}

// ❌ BAD - Event service shouldn't know about invitations
class EventService {
  async createEvent(userId: string, data: CreateEventInput) {
    const event = await this.eventRepo.create(userId, data)
    // DON'T DO THIS - cross-domain operation
    await this.invitationRepo.createForEvent(event.id)
    return event
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Application Layer (`server/application/`)

**Responsibility:** Orchestrate multiple domains for complex workflows

**Contains:**
- Application services
- tRPC routers (for application services)
- Cross-domain coordination

**Rules:**
- ✅ Can call multiple domain services
- ✅ Can coordinate transactions
- ✅ Can aggregate data
- ❌ Should not contain business logic
- ❌ Should not access repositories directly

**Example:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Application service orchestrates
class HouseholdManagementService {
  constructor(
    private householdService: HouseholdService,
    private guestService: GuestService,
    private invitationService: InvitationService,
    private eventService: EventService
  ) {}

  async createHouseholdWithGuests(userId: string, data: CreateHouseholdInput) {
    // 1. Create household
    const household = await this.householdService.create(userId, data)

    // 2. Create guests for household
    const guests = await this.guestService.createManyForHousehold(
      household.id,
      data.guests
    )

    // 3. Get all user events
    const events = await this.eventService.getUserEvents(userId)

    // 4. Create invitations for each guest for each event
    await this.invitationService.createForGuests(guests, events)

    return { household, guests }
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Incremental Migration** - One domain at a time
2. **Backward Compatibility** - Old code works alongside new
3. **Test Coverage** - Verify functionality before and after
4. **Type Safety** - Maintain full TypeScript coverage
5. **No Database Changes** - Keep current Prisma schema

### Migration Order (Simple → Complex)

```
Phase 1: Foundation & Simple Domains (Week 1)
├── Setup infrastructure
├── 1. User Domain          (simple, no dependencies)
├── 2. Website Domain       (simple, depends on User)
└── 3. Event Domain         (simple, few dependencies)

Phase 2: Core Domains (Week 2)
├── 4. Gift Domain          (simple, tracking only)
├── 5. Guest Domain         (moderate complexity)
└── 6. Invitation Domain    (depends on Event + Guest)

Phase 3: Complex Domains (Week 3)
├── 7. Question Domain      (handles Event + Website, has Options/Answers)
└── 8. Household Domain     (complex, many dependencies)

Phase 4: Application Services (Week 4)
├── 9. Household Management Service
├── 10. RSVP Submission Service
└── 11. Dashboard Service

Phase 5: Cleanup & Frontend (Week 5)
├── 12. Remove old routers
├── 13. Reorganize frontend components
├── 14. Update documentation
└── 15. Final testing & deployment
```

**Total Estimated Time:** 4-5 weeks (part-time)

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (4-6 hours)

**Goal:** Create infrastructure and establish pattern

**Steps:**

1. **Create folder structure**
```bash
mkdir -p src/server/domains
mkdir -p src/server/application
mkdir -p src/server/infrastructure/database
mkdir -p src/server/infrastructure/storage
mkdir -p src/lib/constants
mkdir -p src/lib/types
```

2. **Move database client**
```typescript
// src/server/infrastructure/database/client.ts
export { db } from '~/server/db'
```

3. **Create constants**
```typescript
// src/lib/constants/rsvp.ts
export const RSVP_STATUS = {
  NOT_INVITED: 'Not Invited',
  INVITED: 'Invited',
  ATTENDING: 'Attending',
  DECLINED: 'Declined',
} as const
```

4. **First domain: User**
- Simple domain, no complex dependencies
- Establishes the pattern
- `user.types.ts`, `user.repository.ts`, `user.service.ts`, `user.router.ts`

5. **Test thoroughly**
- All existing user operations work
- No regressions

---

### Phase 2-3: Migrate Core Domains (2-3 hours per domain)

**Per Domain Checklist:**

- [ ] Create `{domain}/` folder
- [ ] Extract types to `{domain}.types.ts`
- [ ] Extract Zod schemas to `{domain}.validator.ts`
- [ ] Create `{domain}.repository.ts`
  - Move all Prisma queries
  - Keep methods focused and simple
- [ ] Create `{domain}.service.ts`
  - Business logic
  - Authorization checks
  - Error handling
- [ ] Create `{domain}.router.ts`
  - Thin layer
  - Just input validation + service call
- [ ] Add barrel export `index.ts`
- [ ] Update `server/api/root.ts`
- [ ] Test all operations
- [ ] Update frontend if needed

---

### Phase 4: Application Services (6-8 hours)

**Goal:** Extract cross-domain orchestration

**Services to Create:**

1. **Household Management Service** (3-4 hours)
   - Complex household creation
   - Guest + Invitation coordination

2. **RSVP Submission Service** (2-3 hours)
   - Guest-facing RSVP flow
   - Household + Guest + Invitation + Question

3. **Dashboard Service** (2-3 hours)
   - Aggregate multiple domains
   - Calculate statistics

---

### Phase 5: Frontend & Cleanup (8-10 hours)

**Goal:** Reorganize components and clean up

**Tasks:**

1. **Move components** (4-5 hours)
```bash
# From:
src/app/_components/forms/event-form.tsx

# To:
src/app/_components/event/event-form.tsx
```

2. **Update imports** (2-3 hours)
```typescript
// Update all frontend imports to new paths
import { EventForm } from '~/app/_components/event/event-form'
```

3. **Remove old code** (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Delete old routers
rm src/server/api/routers/event.ts
rm src/server/api/routers/guest.ts
# etc.
```

4. **Update documentation** (1 hour)

## Example Implementations

### Complete Event Domain

See existing Event Domain example in previous section (lines 484-741)

---

### Question Domain (Unified)

```typescript
// question.types.ts
export type Question = {
  id: string
  eventId: string | null      // Optional
  websiteId: string | null     // Optional
  text: string
  type: 'Text' | 'Option'
  isRequired: boolean
}

export type CreateQuestionInput = {
  text: string
  type: 'Text' | 'Option'
  isRequired: boolean
  eventId?: string
  websiteId?: string
  options?: Array<{ text: string; description: string }>
}

// question.service.ts
export class QuestionService {
  async createQuestion(data: CreateQuestionInput) {
    // Enforce: must belong to Event OR Website, not both
    this.validateContext(data)

    return this.questionRepo.create(data)
  }

  private validateContext(data: CreateQuestionInput) {
    const hasEvent = !!data.eventId
    const hasWebsite = !!data.websiteId

    if (!hasEvent && !hasWebsite) {
      throw new TRPCError({
        code: 'BAD_REQUEST',
        message: 'Question must belong to either Event or Website',
      })
    }

    if (hasEvent && hasWebsite) {
      throw new TRPCError({
        code: 'BAD_REQUEST',
        message: 'Question cannot belong to both Event and Website',
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Application Service

```typescript
// application/dashboard/dashboard.service.ts
import { EventService } from '~/server/domains/event'
import { GuestService } from '~/server/domains/guest'
import { HouseholdService } from '~/server/domains/household'
import { InvitationService } from '~/server/domains/invitation'
import { WebsiteService } from '~/server/domains/website'
import { UserService } from '~/server/domains/user'

export class DashboardService {
  constructor(
    private eventService: EventService,
    private guestService: GuestService,
    private householdService: HouseholdService,
    private invitationService: InvitationService,
    private websiteService: WebsiteService,
    private userService: UserService
  ) {}

  async getOverview(userId: string) {
    // Parallel fetch all data
    const [user, website, events, households] = await Promise.all([
      this.userService.getById(userId),
      this.websiteService.getByUserId(userId),
      this.eventService.getUserEvents(userId),
      this.householdService.getUserHouseholds(userId),
    ])

    // Get RSVP statistics for all events
    const eventsWithStats = await Promise.all(
      events.map(async (event) => {
        const stats = await this.invitationService.getStatsForEvent(event.id)
        return { ...event, stats }
      })
    )

    // Calculate guest counts
    const totalGuests = households.reduce(
      (sum, household) => sum + household.guests.length,
      0
    )

    // Calculate days until wedding
    const mainEvent = events.find((e) => e.name.toLowerCase().includes('ceremony'))
    const daysRemaining = mainEvent?.date
      ? Math.ceil(
          (new Date(mainEvent.date).getTime() - new Date().getTime()) /
            (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
        )
      : null

    return {
      user: {
        groomFirstName: user.groomFirstName,
        groomLastName: user.groomLastName,
        brideFirstName: user.brideFirstName,
        brideLastName: user.brideLastName,
      },
      website,
      events: eventsWithStats,
      households,
      stats: {
        totalGuests,
        totalHouseholds: households.length,
        daysRemaining,
      },
    }
  }
}

// application/dashboard/dashboard.router.ts
import { createTRPCRouter, protectedProcedure } from '~/server/api/trpc'
import { dashboardService } from './index'

export const dashboardRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  getOverview: protectedProcedure.query(({ ctx }) => {
    return dashboardService.getOverview(ctx.auth.userId)
  }),
})
```
